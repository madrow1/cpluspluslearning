Variables
int : basic numbers : 1, -5, can use normal representation, can use hex and binary numbers 
float: decimals, must have a trailing "f" : 0.45f 
double: float literal without trailing "f" : 46.3
char: 8 bit character representation : "a"
string: string of characters: "this is a string" 

Assignments are a line of code that assigns a value to a variable

OPERATORS 
Math: + - * / % 
Bitwise: | & ^
Logical: && || !
Relational: == != > < >= <= 
Pointer: * & ->

Type inference 
auto : 
These variables have a variable type depending on the value assigned, however that value must be assigned on initialsation.

CONSTANTS
identifiers with values that will not change during execution: size of a screen or length of a memory buffer 

Arrays
a sequential block of memory addresses 

Structures can be used to impliment simple models that do not require data 

Classes are more complex structures, they can be used for implimenting models, contain data and function members
